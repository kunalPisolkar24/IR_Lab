üéØ **Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the basic concepts and principles of Information Retrieval (IR).
* Study different indexing techniques used in IR systems.
* Analyze the performance of information retrieval systems using advanced techniques like classification, clustering, and filtering, especially in multimedia contexts.
* Learn about various evaluation methods for IR systems.
* Understand the challenges and considerations for scaling basic IR systems into large-scale search services.
* Explore parallel information retrieval and web structures.

üí° **Course Outcomes:**

Upon successful completion of this laboratory course, students will be able to:

* **CO1:** Implement basic information retrieval concepts and build a simple IR system.
* **CO2:** Develop techniques to improve the quality and relevance of retrieved information.
* **CO3:** Apply advanced techniques like classification, clustering, and filtering to analyze multimedia information.
* **CO4:** Evaluate and analyze the performance of information retrieval systems using appropriate metrics.
* **CO5:** Understand the role of information retrieval in various applications and extensions.
* **CO6:**  Gain insights into parallel information retrieval techniques and web structures.

üìÇ **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Text Document Similarity:** <br> Write a program to compute the similarity between two text documents using techniques like cosine similarity or Jaccard index. |
| 2 | **PageRank Algorithm:** <br> Implement the PageRank algorithm, a fundamental algorithm used by search engines to rank web pages. |
| 3 | **Text Pre-processing (Stop Word Removal):** <br> Write a program to pre-process a text document by removing stop words (common words like "the," "a," "is," etc.) to improve retrieval efficiency. |
| 4 | **Character Count (MapReduce):** <br> Write a MapReduce program to count the number of occurrences of each alphabetic character in a given dataset. The count should be case-insensitive and ignore non-alphabetic characters.  |
| 5 | **Word Count (MapReduce):** <br>  Write a MapReduce program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given dataset. The count should be case-insensitive. |
